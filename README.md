# Hunt every mob with your friends in your Minecraft server!

This plugin creates a *nearly* fully customizable fancy GUI and notifiers. While your friends hunting the mobs you can just sit and relax! Everyone is in the same team. What a great thing, right?

# Checking the hunt status
  - /hunt command
  - Boss bar appears on top
> While using the /hunt command you can easily find out which mob is hunted before or not. The name of the head becomes green when the mob is hunted before.


# Edit & Build
You have to compile [CraftBukkit jar](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#compile-craftbukkit) using the Spigot [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#running-buildtools)

After you compiled the craftbukkit jar, move it to the same folder as pom.xml and rename it to **craftbukkit.jar**
