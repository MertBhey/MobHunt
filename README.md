# MobHunt
This plugin creates a *nearly* fully customizable fancy GUI and notifiers. I created this plugin to play with my friends. For this reason, the kills are not user-based. Everyone is on the same team. What a great thing, right?

# Edit & Build
You have to compile [CraftBukkit jar](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#compile-craftbukkit) using the Spigot [BuildTools](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/#running-buildtools)

After you compiled the craftbukkit jar, move it to the same folder as pom.xml and rename it to **craftbukkit.jar**
